        <p><span>Obviously</span>, we’ve styled up all the basic text formatting options available in markdown.</p>
        <p>You can create lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple bulleted lists</li>
            <li>Like this one</li>
            <li>Are cool</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Numbered lists</li>
            <li>Like this other one</li>
            <li>Are great too</li>
        </ol>

            <p>“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”</p>
